## Overview
The Redux Store is a React-driven e-commerce application provided as starter code by the Coding Boot Camp. The code has been modified to use Redux libraries to manage global state instead of React's Context API.
## Programs Used
The provided website was designed with HTML 5, CSS 3.0, and Javascript (2020 Build) in Visual Studio Code 1.58.2. In addition, the website makes use of the MERN full-stack option, in which Mongoose, Express, React, and Node libraries are connected via an Apollo server. Of course, the project also uses the Redux libraries for global state management, hence the name Redux Store.
